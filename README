MC_Google_Visualization Version 0.3
---------------------------------------------
MC_Google_Visualization provides simple support for integrating Google Visualization charts and graphs with your own internal database.  It includes a complete parser for the Google Visualization Query Language, giving you the same ease of pivoting and formatting data from your database as is currently possible with Google Spreadsheets.

Documentation for MC_Google_Visualization can be found at our Google Code project page: http://code.google.com/p/mc-goog-visualization/

Installation
---------------------------------------------
To use MC_Google_Visualization in your own projects, just copy the contents of the "lib" directory somewhere in your PHP include path.  With a simple <?php require_once 'MC/Google/Visualization.php'; ?> you should be all set to go.  See the documentation above for more detailed instructions on the API.

Examples
---------------------------------------------
Some examples can be found in the examples/ directory.  Stick the MC_Google_Visualization files somewhere on a web server with PHP installed, and browse to /examples/ to see the list.  For these examples, PDO with SQLite3 support is required.
